NAME
  kill - terminate or signal a process

DESCRIOTION
  The kill utility sends  asiganl to the processes specified by the pid operands.

  Only the super-user may send siganls to other users' processes.

  The options are as follows:

  -s siganl_name
    A symbolic signal name specifying the siganl to be sent instead of the default TERM.

  -l [exit_status]
    IF no operand is given, list the siganl names; otherwise, write the siganl name corresponding to exit_status.

  -signal_name
    A symbolic signal name specifying signal to be setn insetead of the DEFAULt TERM.

  -signal_number
    A non-negative decimal integer, specifying the signal to be sent instead of the default TERM.

  The following PIDs have special meanings:

  -1 If superuser, broadcast the siganl to all processes; otherwise broadcast to all processess belonging to the user.

  Some of the more commonly used signals:

  1 HUP(hang up)
  2 INT(interrupt)
  3 QUIT(quit)
  6 ABRT(abort)
  9 KILL(non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
  14 ALRM(alarm clock)
  15 TERM(software termination signal)

  Some shells may provide a builtin kill command which is similar or identical to this utility. Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

EXIT STATUS
  The kill utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
