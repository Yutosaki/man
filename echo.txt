ECHO(1)

NAME
  echo - write arguments to the standard output

DESCRIPTION
  The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank (' ') characters and followd by a newline ('\n') character, to the standard output.

  The following option is available:

  -n Do not print the trailing newline character. This may also be achieved by appending '\c' to the end of the string, as is done by iBCS2 compatible systems. Not that this option as well as the effect of '\c' are implementation-defined in IEE Std 1003.1-2001("POSIX.1") as amended by Cor. 1-2002. Applications aiming for maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to suppress the newline character.

  Some shells may provide a builtin efcho command which is simmilar or identical to this utility. Most notably, the builtin echo in sh(1)   does not accept the -n option. Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

EXIT STATUS
  The echo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if and error occurs.
